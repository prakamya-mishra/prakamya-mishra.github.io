<div align="center">Fig. 1: 8 May 2021, I officially became an independent researcher publishing a single author long paper at PAKDD 2021 [Acceptance Rate < 20%].</div>

## Summary

Last year on 29 August, I decided to start working on an independent research project, and earlier this month I published a paper on that same project at PAKDD 2021, one of the major conferences of the field. Yup, that's right! It's completely possible to do independent research and publish a paper in one of the top conferences without any guidance, support, and funding.

It was a great experience with lots of ups & downs, learning, uncertainties, self-doubt, frustration, freedom, and most importantly satisfaction. At this point, I feel it's fair enough to say that I have some insight about doing independent research… “What is it? What does it take to do it? Where to start? Why would you do it? Why won’t you do it? and How to publish it?”... Through this article, I would like to answer these questions and share my experience, insights, and advice on working as an independent researcher. 

## Why did I start doing Research?

<div align="center">Fig. 2: I always make sure that my setup has an extra monitor. Basically, I use the monitor for reading papers/blogs and my mac for implementing stuff. Also, I do most of my work during the night so that I don't get distracted from anything (friends, family, social media, etc.).</div><br><br>

Somewhere during my undergraduate, I fell in love with the field of artificial intelligence and wanted to pursue my higher education specializing in this field. Recently, to get an admit from one of the top universities for graduate studies especially in the field of computer science is very very tough, and it becomes tougher if you want to specialize in the field of artificial intelligence. Due to such an exorbitant competition, you would want to have something in your profile that outshines other applicants and shows your contribution to the field. This might not sound good but it’s the truth, the competition is tougher than ever.

There are many ways to contribute to a field, from being an open-source contributor to producing exciting new research. To me, the research option felt cool. I always wanted to do something that had some “real” impact on society, and to be doing research on real-world problems was the best way I could have had some kind of “real” impact (during your undergraduate studies). This is how I got involved with research from my first year. Later during my undergraduate, I worked on around 5 research projects focusing on different topics, under the guidance of different professors.

<!---
Though I had made up my mind to do some kind of research in the field of artificial intelligence, I still didn’t know where to start. Luckily I had really awesome and helpful seniors who advised me to look into the profiles of a few professors and approach them to discuss my initial research ideas. Although I contacted a professor who was working in the field I was really interested in (Natural Language Processing), but during our meeting, I had no clue about any kind of research ideas. The professor was really cool about it and discussed with me my interests and different research scopes in this field. We decided to have our next meeting when I had pinpointed a research idea. I spent around a month exploring my interests and came up with a few ideas. We had our next meeting and decided upon working on a particular problem. This is how it all started. Later during my undergraduate, I worked on around 5 research projects focusing on different topics, under the guidance of different professors.

## Sarting Independent Research

<div align="center">Fig. 3: These are some of the early-stage model architecture ideas for solving different research problems. Sometimes randomly I get some ideas, so I make sure to document them immediately.</div><br><br>

After graduating, I had to defer my plans for pursuing a master's last year due to COVID-19. Yup, it was a bummer but what else you can do. During the same time, I was also dealing with some other stuff in my personal life. Long story short, in August, instead of taking up a job, I decided to take a year off to work on whatever I liked. Obviously, I was interested in doing some research I liked, but the problem with doing any kind of research this time was that I had no guidance from any professors, which made it very difficult to narrow down on ideas to work on. This was the first time I had to decide my research topic totally on my own.

<div align="center">Fig. 4: Trust me and start reading Attack on Titan manga (Totaly recommend reading manga and listning to AOT OST).</div><br><br>

Anyways, one day I was watching the latest episode of Attack on Titans (anime), and a random idea came to my mind: “What if I could translate the audio from one language (Japanese) to another (English) without losing the tone expression, accent, mode of delivery...etc, which would make it more interesting to watch animes in other languages and also eliminate the need to see subtitles.”. This idea fascinated me a lot and decied to work on it. Immediately after fixing my research idea, I also decided a target conference workshop of a premium NLP conference (NLPBT workshop @ EMNLP 2020) where I would like to submit my research paper. Since this time there was no professor to report to (contrary to my undergraduate research), choosing a target conference was really important so that I could work without slacking and in a disciplined manner. 

Now that I had my idea and a target conference, all I needed to do was to work on it. I started by dividing the research problem into sub-parts and reading about all the existing works. It took me around two-three weeks to get a complete picture of all the eisting works related to this topic. I didn’t stop reading here, but I had a good understanding of the existing works. Next month, I was  busy designing and implementing data preprocessing pipelines, different model architectures, and evaluation metrics. Every other night I used to get stuck into either some bug or some disappointing result. It might sound super easy to implement stuff, but it really isn’t. 

The main problem while working independently is that you can stop working anytime you want without any repercussions. Another problem is that you have no one that can point out your mistakes or correct you when you are spiraling down the wrong path. These were not the things I knew from the beginning. I had to struggle every night to decipher why my model was not working the way I wanted it to. It was really frustrating to get stuck on petty problems for days. Sometimes I was working on the same component of the model for weeks, which resulted in burnouts and lack of interest. As days went by and the number of problems increased, it became very difficult to focus and stay motivated. During such a time the target conference deadline kept me in check.

<div align="center">Fig. 5: Ahh, don't even get me start! Processing power for working on SOTA AI research will always be the primary problem you will face during your undergraduate studies. So imagine working completly indepently without any funding in the field.</div><br><br>

Things started to become more frustrating when I started scaling up the dataset. Since I had no resources and no one was supporting me, at max, I was able to use google collab free services, which proved to be not sufficient for my proposed model. This was the point where I was stuck for weeks. Although I faced problems before this where I could have stopped the project, this one felt beyond my ability to solve. I seriously stopped working on this project for a week or so. During this break, I was subconsciously still thinking of how I could make things work and started reading a few more blogs/papers on how to experiment with large models using limited resources. Fianally, I was successfully able to find some way around to train my model on google collab. Within another two months, I was successfully able to complete all the experiments and write a paper. I rushed it at the end, but actually writing the paper atleast took me around two-three weeks. It could have been more but I guess my undergraduate research experience helped me alot. It was not the first time that I was writing a paper, but it was definetly the first time that I was writing apaper without any guidance from an eperienced professor or researcher. Anyways, I believe I did a reseaonable job to write a decent paper.

<div align="center">Fig. 6: NLPBT 2021 (EMNLP workshop) reviews.</div><br><br>

Finally, I successfully submitted my paper to the target conference workshop. A month later I received an email from the workshop that my paper was rejected. Although the paper was rejected, my work received some really good feedback with a borderline rejection. To me this meant that my paper had a really good chance of getting accepted if I worked on those feedbacks. So I took it all positively and worked on those changes. Next time, I submitted the revised version to a premium conference (EACL 2020) as a long paper, but it again recieved borderline rejection. They also gave some good feedback on my work along with suggestions to improve but this time it was a bit different. Not only that my paper was a long paper for the main conference instead of a workshop, but also two out of three reviewers accepted the paper with a 4 out of 5 ratings ( last time all the reviewers gave a rating of 3). This improvement encouraged me to further work on those suggestions. After making all the desired changes, I submitted the final version of my paper to PAKDD 2021, and guess what?... a month later I received the acceptance mail of my paper to the main conference with an oral presentation. That day I officially became an Independent researcher.

## Insights from my Research Experience

1. Usually, early undergrads are scared of doing research, and they think it is some “hi-fi” stuff that requires a lot of prerequisite knowledge. Let me break it to you, it is not entirely true. Of Course, it requires you to have some basics, but that is enough for you to start. One can read about things as and when they are required. For example, in the case of machine learning, If you are sound with the basics of python programming, linear algebra, and probability & statistics, then you are good to go. Even if the research idea you decided to work on requires you to know about something that you are unfamiliar with, then also don’t get scared and quit the project. You can easily grasp the required knowledge in a matter of months, and to do this I would advise you to read different papers and blogs about it. Reading papers might be daunting at first but, in my experience that is the best thing you can do to increase the quality of your research. Reading papers not only help you in gaining knowledge about the concepts involved, but also helps you to get familiar with the jargon, the style of writing a scientific paper, and the steps of conducting your experiments. 

2. To understand a paper properly, I would recommend reading it twice or thrice. The first time you read it, you will get a big picture about “what the paper is talking about”, “what is the main objective”, “what solution was proposed by the paper”, “what experiments were conducted for validation”, etc. The second time you read it, you will get a better understanding of each component of the paper, and still, if you don't understand some of the stuff, you can read it again or google the specific things that are still bothering you about the paper. 

3. I have also observed that a lot of people struggle in finding ideas. It’s completely natural, and I used to have the same problem when I started. After a few years of research experience, I realized that there are mainly 2 ways of finding ideas for your research. The first is by reading more papers and finding ways to improve the existing solutions. The more papers you read, the more ideas you get about how researchers improve upon old ideas. Also reading papers from different domains helps you in finding correlations, which helps in solving problems in one domain using solutions applied in another domain. The second way is to come up with a problem on your own. It is not as difficult as it sounds. There are problems everywhere you look, it’s just a matter of your ability to identify them. In my experience, the more you practice identifying problems in your day-to-day activities, the more proficient you will be in coming up with new research ideas.

4. To me, research can be treated as a project with a detailed report. So basically any research project has two parts, the first is the implementation and the second is the paper itself. Usually, it is considered ethical to release the implementation code of your research project for reproducibility. So similar to writing a paper, code also has a style of writing which can be excelled by going over the code implementations of the existing works from the pioneers of the industry. Almost all the implementations are available on Github. Similarly, writing a paper is also an art. I would advise you to read papers from the top conferences. Not only will it keep you updated with the latest research work, but also it will train you to write quality papers. As you will read more and more papers, you will adapt the jargon and style of writing a scientific paper. Both of these will get better with practice. I am still working on it and learning new things daily.

5. Personally, I won't recommend you to directly start doing independent research. It would be better if you first start working under someone's guidance. This would not only help you to know the actual workflow of conducting research but would also train you to tackle problems during your research projects. Most of the time, if you get stuck somewhere, your guide would have some idea about the problem and how to solve it because they might have had gone through similar problems when they started. That's why I would suggest that you should spend a considerable time deciding your guide since that will play a major role in your overall growth. 

6. Another piece of advice that I give to most of my juniors is that, if you are not able to identify any research idea, then pick a conference workshop and start doing one of the shared tasks. Basically, sharded tasks are well-defined research-based competitions that not only have a set problem statement but also provide you with the dataset. So the only thing you need to do is to come up with a solution and implement it. This eliminates the time of exploring research ideas and finding datasets.

7. Use Twitter and Reddit not just for memes but also for staying up-to-date about recent advances in your field. Try following all the researchers, research labs, and companies of your interest. This would not only keep you updated with the resect research works but also you would be able to learn some new things from the discussions between these researchers online. Similar discussions can be found happening in different subreddits like r/MachineLearning. You don't need to read about everything, but you can briefly look over what's happing in your domain. 

8. Having diverse and similar-minded people in my friend circle during my undergraduate studies helped me a lot. Having such a group of friends led to intense and fun discussions between us. The topic of discussions ranged from biomedical science to probabilistic modeling to latest research in deep neural networks. Having such a group of friends not only helped each of us to stay motivated but also helped us in assisting each other whenever someone needed help.

9. Don't target a paper, but instead target the experimental results. It is really common to see early undergraduates running towards a paper for their graduate applications and forgetting about the quality of research. I am not saying that it was not the case with me when I started, but I learned during my journey that having unpublished good quality research (pre-print) is far better than having a shitty published paper.

10. The last piece of advice I would like to give you that, always follow your heart. If you want to do independent research, then do it! If you want to work in a particular field, then do it! If you want to take a break, then take it!... After all, the most important thing is your satisfaction in your work and your mental health. If you are not passionate about what you are doing, then you will never be able to excel above a certain level. There will be a lot of people who will not trust you or demean whatever you do. Never let anyone else's words affect your actions. Always take criticism as fuel. 


## Conclusion

I would like to conclude this article by saying that before all this, I never knew that I would be able to publish an independent research paper, but I did, and it was only possible because of my passion, enthusiasm, and discipline. The purpose of this article was not only to show that independent research is possible but also was to share all the things I learned during my research experience. I hope this article helps you in some way or the other. Please feel free to contact me if you find yourself stuck in your own journey. Thank you for reading.
